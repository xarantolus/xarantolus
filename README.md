Hi, I'm Philipp. I'm currently studying computer science at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de) and program a lot in my free time.

I like:
* Computer architecture and low-level programming
* Building web servers and web apps
* Writing mobile apps using Flutter
* Tinkering with electronics (think connecting sensors, motors etc. to Raspberry Pis and other robotics)
* Introducing automation in areas where it is typically neglected despite making sense

The most technically interesting project you can find on my profile is definitely [my x86-64 emulator for WebAssembly](https://github.com/xarantolus/ax). It allows you to emulate a small x86-64 subset [right in your browser](https://ax.010.one) and powers [another x86 related project of mine](https://github.com/xarantolus/MemeAssembly-playground-vue).

Other than that I've also written a few Android apps, which you can download by adding [this F-Droid repo](https://github.com/xarantolus/fdroid) to your [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) client (or just download the APK releases from GitHub). If you like rockets, you'll feel right at home with my [Space News App](https://github.com/xarantolus/rockit).

Additionally, I also like building self-hostable web servers and respective frontends, like my [music sync](https://github.com/xarantolus/sensibleHub) or [web archive](https://github.com/xarantolus/Collect) servers. I've also been getting into more modern web development with VueJS by writing [this GitHub release stats](https://ghstats.010.one/) site as well as a small [filter list search site](https://filterlists.010.one/).

This was just a broad overview, you can [**find even more projects on my website**](https://010.one).
